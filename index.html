<p>Hi, my name is Jerry. I upgrade things. Things like webapps written in Python or Ruby.</p>

<p>You benefit from my services because your staff are working on the high value parts of your application. Having them spend time learning how to do a certain upgrade is costly and since it is only done once, that knowledge is useless after the upgrade is complete.</p>

<p>I do this repeatedly. The knowledge I gain doing one upgrade carries over to the next. It makes sense.</p>

<p><a href='mailto:jseutter@gmail.com?Subject=Solve%20my%20migration%20issues%21'>
  Get in touch with me.
</a></p>

<p>If you know of an Open Source project that needs my services, <a href='mailto:jseutter@gmail.com?Subject=Solve%20my%20migration%20issues%21'>
  get in touch with me.
</a> I devote a portion of my time to working on Open Source.</p>
